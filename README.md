# Fakes Exposed
A website dedicated to debunking “fake” information (Be it fake, clickbait, intentionally misleading, etc) in the community, initially aimed at the PS4 scene. The goal is to allow newbies to the scene to identify user who post fake information. There will be a browser extension to block the fakes content and redirect to their "profile” on this site, thus depriving them of epeen and views.

### The Site
Will essentially be a list of users known for posting "fake" info. As of now the plan is do have a small breakdown of why they are on the list with proof of their misdeeds.

### The Extension
The browser extension will block by username on various social media sites and have an option of blocking by domain (or specific sub-domain) and full URL. This file is contained at `data.json` and is how we'll avoid privacy issues as no info will be sent to the server besides the request for this file and submissions for new fake postings.

### Appeals Process
Every username/domain/URL added to this list will be vetted for accuracy. If you're on it, you deserve it. There is a *chance* for ONE appeal per user assuming all offending content is removed, any further posts will lock for name on the list forever with an additional mark showing you were given a second chance and blew it.
